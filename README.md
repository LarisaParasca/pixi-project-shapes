# pixi-project-shapes
A small pixi.js project where random shapes with random colors are created and animated from up to bottom. 
On the bottom of the screen there are two fields, one controls the number of the elements shown, the other one controls their gravity(the speed with which they fall). 
Clicking on a shape will make it disappear.
